# Fake Instagram Web app

This web application is a project for the course _Development of Software Systems_ at **University of Szeged**.

## Starting the application

In the root directory of the project, use `docker compose up -d` (-d for detached mode). When the containers are built, the frontend should be available at `localhost:4200`.
Be sure to wait a little as the angular environment has to get started.
